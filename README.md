## 👋 About Me

I am a **Bioinformatics Postdoc** at the **City University of Hong Kong**. 

My work bridges biology and data science. I currently focus on **network-based computational drug repositioning** for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and am actively expanding into **single-cell data analysis**.

## 🛠 Projects & Software

### [Canary](https://github.com/anb94/Canary)
**Published in BMC Bioinformatics.** A singularity-based tool for the semi-automated conversion of MaCH files (mlinfo and mldose) to PLINK files for GWAS analysis. This tool streamlines the workflow for genetic data processing.

### [Minimal RNA-Seq Tutorial](https://github.com/anb94/minimal-rna-seq-tutorial)
**Educational Resource.** A streamlined workflow designed for new students. It covers gene-level exploratory analysis and differential expression on lab servers with minimal setup required.
